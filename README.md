Music Playlist Manager – C++ Project
Overview
Music Playlist Manager is a console-based C++ application that enables users to manage a dynamic music playlist. It utilizes fundamental data structures such as Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks, and Deques, and applies standard sorting and searching algorithms to simulate the functionality of a basic music player.

Features
Add and remove songs

Display the full playlist

Sort playlist:

By title using Merge Sort (A–Z)

By duration using Bubble Sort

Search songs by title:

Using Linear Search (for unsorted playlists)

Using Binary Search (for sorted playlists)

Track recently played songs using a Stack

Manage the play queue using a Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

Data Structures and Algorithms Used
Doubly Linked List – for playlist storage and navigation

Singly Linked Stack – for tracking recently played songs

Doubly Linked Deque – for managing the song play queue

Merge Sort – efficient sorting by title

Bubble Sort – simple sorting by duration

Linear Search – suitable for unsorted data

Binary Search – efficient for sorted playlists
