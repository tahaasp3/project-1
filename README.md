# Music Playlist Manager (C++ Project)

## Overview

**Music Playlist Manager** is a C++ console application that allows users to manage their music playlist dynamically. It uses fundamental data structures like **Doubly Linked List**, **Stack**, and **Deque**, and implements **sorting** and **searching** algorithms to provide features similar to a basic music player.

---

## Features

* Add and remove songs
* Display full playlist
* Sort songs by:

  * **Title** using Merge Sort (A–Z)
  * **Duration** using Bubble Sort
* Search songs by title using:

  * **Linear Search**
  * **Binary Search**
* Track recently played songs using **Stack**
* ⏯Manage play queue using **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**
